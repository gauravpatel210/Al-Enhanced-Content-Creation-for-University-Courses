## Business Objective
The primary objective is to reduce the time and effort needed to generate and retrieve relevant course content. Key goals include:

- Efficiency: Minimizing time for content search and creation.
- Accuracy: Ensuring AI understands and responds accurately based on context.
- Plagiarism-Free: Providing unique responses derived from document context or general knowledge.
## Project Scope
- Software: Visual Studio Code
- Libraries: FAISS, Google Generative AI (genAI), LangChain, PyPDF2, Streamlit
- System Requirements:
 - Hardware: Minimum 4GB RAM, 50GB storage, Intel i5 (8th gen or higher)
 - Operating System: Windows 10/11 or Linux (Ubuntu)
 - Network: High-speed internet
